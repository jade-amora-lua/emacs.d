This is my main emacs config dir. There are still some libraries
hanging around in my disk, but I intend to keep everything here from
now on.

For everything to work, I have only a symbolic link from ~/.emacs to
/path/to/repo/emacs. There are some hard-coded paths around, removing
them is my to-do list (but low-priority).
